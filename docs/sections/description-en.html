An OWL representation of the AIRM &ndash; the AIRM Ontology (AIRM-O) &ndash; facilitates handling in practice.
AIRM-O is a semi-automatic derivation of AIRM and as such closely follows the structure and semantics of the UML models.
We hence refer to the <a href="http://airm.aero/">AIRM website</a> for general information on meaning and usage of the model elements themselves.
In addition to that, we provide support material (see <a href="#references">references</a>) that illustrates potential applications of AIRM-O in practice and describes how to work with AIRM-O.
